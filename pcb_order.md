<h3>How to request a PCB manufacturing service?</h3>

<p align="justify">Today it is extremely easy and affordable to prototype PCBs. The following is a tutorial on how you can request a PCB manufacturing service.</p>

<p align="justify">After designing the robot's PCB, we requested the services of the <a href="https://jlcpcb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JLCPCB company</a>, as it is good in quality and low cost. 
  Of course, other companies are just as good, so feel free to choose.</p>
  
<p align="justify">About the color of the PCB, we opted for the white color because it improves the brightness performance of the LEDs, but there are no restrictions on this.</p>
  
<p align="justify">Although we used some SMD components, we had no difficulty using the soldering iron to solder them. That way, a stencil board was not required.</p>

<p align="justify">To start an order, simply download the <a href="https://github.com/verlab/hero_common/blob/nodemcu/hero_resources/schematic/EAGLE/projects/hero_v2.6/board_2022-04-20.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerber File</a>, and send it to the PCB manufacturing service of your choice. Just pay attention to these requirements:</p>

 <ul class="fa-ul" style="list-style: none;">
  <li> Finished Copper >= 1 oz</li>
  <li> Min Hole Size: 0.3mm</li>
  <li> Min Track/Spacing: 6/6mil</li>
 </ul>

<p align="justify">After a few days we receive the PCBs and we can start assembling the components.</p>

 <p>An Open Platform for Swarm Robotics Research</p>
 
 <p align="justify">Check The design of a novel platform for swarm robotics applications that is low cost, easy to assemble using off-the-shelf components, and deeply integrated with the most used robotic framework available today: ROS (Robot Operating System). The robotic platform is entirely open, composed of a 3D printed body and open-source software.</p>

## Requirements
The robot was designed so that it is easy to assemble and reproduce. To build and operate a robot, you need:

- Order some electronic components, motors, screws, etc...
- Order PCB board;
- Skills with soldering iron (SMD);
- Programming practice (Arduino, ROS);
